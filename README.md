# ðŸŽ° Password Generator


This is a simple password generator project using only HTML, CSS and JS. It was made in the beginning of my studies about **front-end** and **programming logic**.

To get your password generated, you can choose its length between:

- 10 characters
- 12 characters
- 14 characters

Then, you click on *Generate Password* and it's ready to be used. Also, you can hold the *Show* button to see your password or either copy it to your clipboard.
